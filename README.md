# ClassificationSystem
This is a system that I developed in my work to help my client's daily work.
To develop the application, my project coordinator chose ASP.NET WebForms, and then I used:
 Database: SQL Server;
 Back-end: C#;
 Front-end: HMTL, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap.

This application aims to insert, update and delete rules and rankings.
My job was to talk to the client to understand their daily work and, with that focus, create an application where they will no longer have to use Excel to perform their activities.
